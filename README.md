# worldastical
Hello

Welcome, one and all, to the development of Worldastical. This is a tool for writers and authors to build fantastical worlds for their works, be it novels, video games, or other forms of art. Have you ever struggled with forming a world, one you have a faint idea of? Maybe you want to build a world where everyone is forced to keep diary entries post-apocalypse. Maybe you want to write about a world where plants are sentient and animals are, decidedly, not. Or maybe you just want to bring to life the worlds in which your toy cars lived and fought. Whatever you aim, this tool is meant to help you organize your thoughts and guide your journey in building this world. What questions does one ask? How does one organize all their notes about the world? Could you just answer the questions post by this tool and find exactly what you were looking for? Or is this too high an aim for a beginner's project?

Contributions and ideas are welcome.
