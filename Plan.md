### Name
What is the name of the world? Put something in as a placeholder, we'll come back to this.

## Inspiration
Think about your story. Now think about the vibes of the world you're trying to create. Do you know what your real-world inspiration for your fantasy is? (If 'yes', enter the inspiration. Else, enter 'no')
(This part only starts if 'no')
Start with time period: what time period is it closest to? (Include three options: past, present, future)
(Past)
Think about historical fiction. Is this similar to Regency Era England, Ancient China, or America admist the World War? Try to find a time period and place that matches the vibe of your story. What is the best match? 
(Present) 
What present country has a similar vibe and tone for your story? Is it a democracy or is it like North Korea, trapping its inhabitants? This is a great time to research countries if you're not sure. 
(Future)
A world of the future is hard to relate to the modern, real-life, world. That doesn't mean its impossible, though. What country do you expect, several years in the future, to look the most like your world? Or, if you're feeling even more adventerous, what planets are included in your world (enter as a comma separated list)?

## Geology
The best way to do this part is to visualize. I'm not sure if you're a traditional paper person or a web person so I'll tell you how to do both. On paper, pour some rice and draw along the greater outlines. Online, go to [this website](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/). Don't pay too much attention to the map yet, we're just here for a random outline. 
Now, think about the main features you want the part of the world your story takes place to have. If this story spans over the entire world, what diverse features do you want to include? Snowy mountains and parched deserts? What else? First and foremost, decide the scope of your world: small or large? (Keep your story in mind)
Great, now think about some really cool scenes you want in your story. Where do they take place? At the edge of a dangerously tall cliff? On the docks of a harbor? Out in the open sea, up in the sky, what are some cool stages and locations? It's tempting to want to think about every aspect of the world, but we're not gods. (type "stop" to end the input sequence).

## Political Geography
There are no doubt governing systems in your world. For the sake of convenience, we'll refer to them as "countries" in this app. How many countries are in your world? What are their defining features? Enter in the form of country : features. Type 'stop' when completed.
How are these countries separated? By mountain ranges, rivers, walls of fire, millions of miles of empty space, or just politically drawn imaginary lines? Keeping these ideas in mind, enter the relations in the form of country 1 - country 2 : border feature(s). Type 'stop' when completed.
Use a known language (or perhaps you've created your own) to generate country names based on the inspiration you picked earlier. 

## Symbolism
Use your inspiration to see how this works in real life. What are important things to each country? Think about the USA with its bald eagles and flag elements. Enter these potential elements in the form of Country : element 1, element 2, etc. Type 'stop' to exit sequence. 

## Religion
Religion is an important drive of humankind. You might not want to think about this, but the belief systems of people makes the world seem more real, even if you don't intend to address it directly in your book. What are important things for your people? What are values that different peoples debate against? What force keeps people on the morally right path? Is there one God, multiple Gods, or just the fear of the unknown? Write a couple sentences answering these questions so that you can refer to this later:

## Politics
Politics is inescapable, both in reality and fantasy. Again, this is a major plot progressor. Politics defines the world, its people, and their differences. Think about the main country your story will take place in. What are the political issues at play? What is the power system? If multiple countries are involved, what are the striking differences? Which countries' leaders strive for power and wish to conquer? Which leaders are trying to progress science and economy, which are trying to progress the arts? In short, what is the political state of your world? Is it embroiled in world wars, is it a peaceful time with slight economic tensions? Try to make a mindmap elsewhere connecting each country and its leaders. Here, though, just write a few sentences for each country in the form of country - allies - enemies - leaders - goals.
